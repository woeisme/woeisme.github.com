title: A very good question

So Barnaby is sitting next to my other left being either confusing or sarcastic, I haven't decided yet. I suspect however he's taking advantage of my severed tired 
state in order to amuse himself. Fortunately attention has been seized for a brief moment as we discuss self-driving cars. I think we'll work on fixing this long
neglected blog. I better end this post now before Barnaby is seized by hakkavelin's resident question master. I won't say who that is.
