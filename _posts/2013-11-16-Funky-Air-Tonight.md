Despite my best intentions its been a bit since updating, one of the fellow hakkavelin fellows helped me sort out some 
of the issues I was having with using github as a blogging mechanism. Truth be told however I've forgotten most of what we figured
 out. It involves gh-branches always lagging behind master and origin on github and the necessity of updating all of it at once, or 
more importantly REMEMBERing to update it all at once. I think if I was a bit more ambitious about this blog I'd just move it to 
another service instead of this clever but complicated github hack.
